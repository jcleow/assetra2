ASSETRA PHASE 3: COMPREHENSIVE SCENARIO PLANNING FOR SINGAPORE SANDWICHED GENERATION
===================================================================================

USER PERSONA: ALEX CHEN (32, SINGAPORE)
========================================
- Mid-level operations manager ("salary man") at a logistics MNC, ~S$9.5k/month base + AWS (~S$120k all-in)
- Mandatory CPF contributions (20% employee / 17% employer) and a 7% marginal income tax rate reduce take-home cash
- Single, planning to get married within 2-3 years; partner earns ~S$80k and wants to co-plan finances
- Supporting elderly parents (S$1,500/month allowance + occasional medical top-ups)
- Renting a 1-bedroom apartment (S$2,800/month) while waiting for HDB eligibility
- Holds S$80k liquid savings, S$45k in CPF OA, S$25k in CPF SA, and S$20k already invested in STI ETF + US equities
- Dreams: Own HDB BTO, get married, afford 1-2 kids, buy a practical car, retire by 60 with 70% income replacement
- Concerns: Can he afford all his goals while supporting parents and managing CPF/tax obligations? What trade-offs must he make?

PRIMARY USER STORY NARRATIVE
----------------------------
"As Alex, a 32-year-old sandwiched generation salary man in Singapore, I need one command center that shows how buying a home, getting married, starting a family, owning a car, investing, and retiring by 60 all fit together given my CPF contributions, taxes, and insurance needs."

Story Beats (time horizons the product must support):
1. Stabilize Foundations (0-12 months): Track CPF inflows/outflows, income tax, and parental support while sizing an emergency fund and core insurance coverage.
2. Housing + Marriage (12-36 months): Compare BTO vs resale timelines, assess down payments using CPF OA + cash, and schedule wedding costs without delaying the flat or exceeding TDSR/MSR.
3. Family Formation (36-60 months): Model childcare expenses, helper costs, and parental leave income gaps to decide if/when to have kids while still servicing the mortgage.
4. Lifestyle Upgrade Decisions (60-84 months): Evaluate the total cost of owning a car versus reinvesting the money, factoring in COE cycles, childcare logistics, and opportunity cost.
5. Retirement Glidepath (present-60): Project CPF LIFE payouts, taxable income, and investment growth so that Alex knows the trade-offs between aggressive property usage, stock market investing, and insurance top-ups.

Key Questions the platform must answer for Alex:
- How do CPF contribution limits, OA usage caps, and income tax reliefs impact his monthly cash flow at each life stage?
- What is the safest housing path (BTO, resale, or condo) that still lets him fund a wedding and plan for kids?
- When does it become cash-flow positive to have one or two children while supporting parents and saving for retirement?
- Can he responsibly own a car without compromising childcare, insurance, and investment goals?
- What insurance mix (health, term, critical illness, disability) closes downside risks while staying within budget?
- How much must he invest annually (CPF + cash portfolio) to retire by 60 with desired lifestyle even if markets underperform?
