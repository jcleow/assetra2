        "Planner shell (`components/property-planner/property-planner-shell.tsx`) lets users edit the \"Currently modeling\" description per property type without losing defaults.",
        "Charts share amortization data derived on the client, include labeled axes, and stretch to ~28% viewport height for readability.",
        "UI state is still mock-driven via `PROPERTY_PLANNER_MOCKS` but is wired to `useFinancialPlanningStore` for monthly income and projections.",
        "Spec captures the UX contract (cards shown, helper text, empty-state messaging) so backend schemas can mirror the required fields."

        "Mortgage wizard section displays the inputs, overview cards, and dual charts exactly as seen in the latest UI build.",

        "Charts expand responsively, show evenly spaced year ticks, and display the new crimson/blue palette.",
        "Spec clearly states that data is mocked today and will be replaced once persistence APIs land.",
        "Ticket acts as documentation only (no further engineering work required)."
